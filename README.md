This project was created by me during my college internship to learn basic Python programming and GUI development. The application helps users manage their daily tasks in an easy way.
PROJECT PURPOSE:
          The main purpose of this project is to create a simple desktop application where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks. It also helps in understanding how data can be saved using files.
TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES:
          • Python Programming Language
          • Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface
          • JSON file for storing task data
ABOUT THE APPLLICATION:
          The To-Do List application allows the user to enter a task title, priority, and due date. All tasks are displayed in a list. The user can mark tasks as completed or remove them when they are done. The data is saved in a file so it is not lost when the application is closed.
HOW THE CODE WORKS:
          The program uses a JSON file to store all tasks. When the application starts, it loads the saved tasks. Buttons are provided to add, edit, delete, and complete tasks. The Tkinter library is used to design the window, buttons, and list display.
WHAT I LEARNED:
          From this project, I learned how to create a GUI application using Python, work with files using JSON, and organize code into functions.
CONCLUSION:
          This project helped me improve my understanding of Python basics and GUI development. It was a useful learning experience during my internship.
